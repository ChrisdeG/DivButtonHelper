# Clickable Container
A Mendix widget that can make any container clickable. Place it in a container and set the microflow or URL you want to use.

## Typical usage scenario

Dashboards with clickable areas, like text, KPIs, or any other content! Also useful in any other case where you need a Mendix container to be clickable.
 
## Description

The package contains 2 widgets: a context and a non-context version. The non-context version can do the following on click:
 - Run a microflow
 - Open a specified URL either in the same tab or a new one
 - Open a page in content or a pop-up
  
The context version can also use an attribute of a context object for the URL to open. Additionally, you can use a boolean attribute to determine whether the URL will open in the same tab or a new one.
